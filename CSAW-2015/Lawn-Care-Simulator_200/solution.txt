The attack is a multi-step process. First, we find the username by attacking sign_up.php.

The query:
$query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE username LIKE '$user';";

Since it uses LIKE, we can put "%" as username as a wildcard. The page then tells us that the username "~~FLAG~~" is not available. Thus, we have our username.

The password for premium.php is validated by validate_pass.php.
The program first checks if the password is of the right length,
then checks the password character by character with a delay of 300 milliseconds
between each character. We need to find both the first character and the proper 
length to see the effect of the sleep. After that, we keep trying every 
character possible and selecting the ones that add a 300 ms delay.
